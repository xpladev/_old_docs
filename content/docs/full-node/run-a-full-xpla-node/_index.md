# Run a Full Xpla Node

{{< hint warning >}}
This guide has been tested against Linux distributions only. To ensure a successful production environment setup, consider using a Linux system.
{{< /hint >}}

Running a full Xpla node is a resource-intensive process that requires a persistent server. If you want to use Xpla without downloading the entire blockchain, use [Xpla web wallet](https://vault.xpla.io/).

If you are a developer and want to install `xplad`, visit [xplad install guide]({{< ref "install-xplad" >}}).
