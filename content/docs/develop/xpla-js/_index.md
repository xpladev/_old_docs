:::{admonition} Using xpla.js on the new Xpla chain
:class: tip

Outside of the deprecation of the treasury, market, and oracle modules, xpla.js functionality remains relatively unchanged.
:::


xpla.js seeks to provide a compatible way to work with the Xpla blockchain within JavaScript runtimes, such as Node.js and the browser. xpla.js enables the following functions:

- Deserializing blockchain data into JavaScript objects with native data types and methods
- Serializing objects back into a blockchain-compatible format
- Providing access to the `xplad` node API (LCD) from a JavaScript-based interface
- Providing additional utilities, such as hash functions and key-signing algorithms
