# `xplad`

`xplad` is the command-line interface and node daemon that connects to Xpla and enables you to interact with the Xpla blockchain. Xpla core is the official Golang reference implementation of the Xpla node software.

This guide is for developers who want to install `xplad` and interact with Xpla core without running a full node. If you want to run a full node or join a network, visit [Run a Full Xpla Node]({{< ref "run-a-full-xpla-node" >}}).
