   **Protect your seed phrase**  
   Anyone with your seed phrase can access your money, and there is no recourse for someone stealing your seed phrase. To protect your seed phrase, consider the following tips:
   - Never save or store your seed phrase as a digital file on any device.
   - Always write down your seed phrase with a pen and paper.
   - Store the paper with your seed phrase on it somewhere safe.
   - Never give your seed phrase to anyone, not even support staff.

## Receive Tokens from an Exchange

1. Purchase your tokens using any exchange that supports Xpla.

1. Withdraw any token supported by the Xpla network from your exchange. Every exchange is different. Please visit your exchange's web page for guides on how to withdraw tokens. Use the following steps as a generic guide.

   1. To receive tokens to your wallet, use your wallet address. Your wallet address will appear at the top of the Station Desktop app near your wallet name. Your wallet address will look like this: `xpla<random-numbers-and-letters>`

   1. Double-check your wallet address is correct before sending.

   1. Send the tokens from the exchange to your Station wallet address.

   {{< hint warning >}}
   **Waiting times for transfers**  
   When you transfer tokens from an exchange to Xpla, some time will pass before the tokens appear in your wallet. Don't panic. This waiting period is normal and varies depending on the exchange. If a transfer does not appear immediately, check back after some time.

Now you have tokens on Xpla!

## Send Tokens

1. Open the Station app extension and connect to your wallet.

1. Tap on the token in your available balance that you want to send.  

1. Enter the address of the wallet you want to send tokens to.  

1. Enter the amount you want to send. You can also add a memo to specify what the transaction is for.  

1. Tap **Next**.

1. Verify the transaction amounts and specify which token you want to pay fees in. Remember to always leave enough tokens in your account for other transactions.

   {{< hint warning>}}
   **Keep tokens for fees**  
   Always keep some tokens to pay fees with. Never spend your entire wallet amount. Without money for fees, you can't make any transactions.
   {{< /hint >}}

1.  Enter your password and tap **Confirm**. Wait for the transaction to process. This generally takes a few seconds.
