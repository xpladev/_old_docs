   ```

1. Withdraw any token supported by the Xpla network from your exchange. Every exchange is different. Please visit your exchange's web page for guides on how to withdraw tokens. Use the following steps as a generic guide.

    1. To receive tokens to your wallet, use your wallet address. Your wallet address will appear at the top of the Station app near your wallet name. Your wallet address will look like this: `xpla<random-numbers-and-letters>`

    1. Double-check your wallet address is correct before sending.

    1. Send the tokens from the exchange to your Station wallet address.

   {{< hint warning >}}
   **Waiting times for transfers**  
   When you transfer tokens from an exchange to Xpla, some time will pass before the tokens appear in your wallet. Don't panic. This waiting period is normal and varies depending on the exchange. If a transfer does not appear immediately, check back after some time.
   {{< /hint >}}

Now you have tokens on Xpla!

### Send Tokens

After a few moments, the tokens will appear in the receiver's wallet.
